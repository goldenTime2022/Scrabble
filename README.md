how to play the game :
1. human goes first.
2. computer will auto play next. 
issues:
   when I assign the current=root. current=null. and it shows nullPointException. I don't know how to fix it. 
   but if you command out the computer try to use trie to search all possible words. you only use the human parts. the project will work. human can successfully pick tile and add tiles into board and computer will calculate the total points including the words and letters multiplier.
